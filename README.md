## Importing Data
For this exercise, we will import a series of 222 monthly observations of the U.S. National Debt using the public API from fiscaldata.treasury.gov (https://twitter.com/stlouisfed/status/1290415916430262278). Hint: it can sometimes be useful to break down urls into pieces if multiple calls to the same source will be made.
