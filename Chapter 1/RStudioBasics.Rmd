## Importing Data

For this exercise, we will import a series of 222 monthly observations of the U.S. National Debt using the public API from fiscaldata.treasury.gov (https://twitter.com/stlouisfed/status/1290415916430262278). Hint: it can sometimes be useful to break down urls into pieces if multiple calls to the same source will be made.


```{Specify API Call and Retrieve Data}
require(httr)
require(jsonlite)
urlbase = "https://transparency.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service"
urlend = "/v1/debt/mspd/mspd_table_1"
urlfull = paste(urlbase,urlend,sep="")
raw = GET(urlfull)
```
